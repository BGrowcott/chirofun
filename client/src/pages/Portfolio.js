      text: "Chiropractors are best known for manual treatments such as spinal manipulation, where they use their hands to free stiff or restricted joints, or mobilisation, which is the gradual moving of joints. But they may also use other recommended treatments such as certain types of acupuncture, electrotherapy, stretching exercises and rehabilitation, all of which form part of a chiropractorâ€™s package of care. Your chiropractor may also offer lifestyle advice to help recovery and to prevent repeated episodes of back pain.",
